# iTranz - An Integrated Advanced Technological Solution for Public Transportation

**Objective**: To improve the public bus system's efficiency, safety, and user experience in Sri Lanka by modernizing payments, enhancing safety measures, improving maintenance, and offering real-time passenger information.

**Key Challenges**:
- **Outdated Payment Methods**: Cash transactions cause delays and contribute to environmental waste.
- **Inadequate Safety Measures**: Lack of a reliable system to report harassment deters passengers.
- **Poor Maintenance**: Inconsistent tracking of bus health leads to frequent breakdowns.
- **Lack of Real-Time Information**: No live tracking or seat availability, causing long waiting times.

**Proposed Solutions**:
1. **QR-Based Payment System**: Streamlines fare collection and reduces reliance on cash.
2. **Incident Reporting**: Real-time safety issue reporting to improve passenger security.
3. **Maintenance Tracker**: Automated system for timely bus servicing and reliability.
4. **Real-Time Info**: Live bus tracking and seat availability updates for passengers.

**Outcome**: The project aims to create a more efficient, safe, and user-friendly public transport system, encouraging wider use of buses, reducing traffic, and promoting sustainability.
